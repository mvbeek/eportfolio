This includes identifying stakeholders, funding/budgets and confirming the need for a new system. This may involve a feasibility study that establishes the need, helps determine potential costs, requirements and users.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Analysis</strong><br>The next step is systems analysis. This involves high-level requirements gathering and analysis and business analysis.<br><br><strong>Design</strong><br>The next phase is design, where high level designs covering areas such as user interfaces, business rules, process flows and interactions, state diagrams, data entities and use cases are created and analysed.<br><br><strong>Environments</strong><br>The next phase is the creation (build) of a number of environments such as development, test, integration, staging and deployment. Each of these will be sized appropriate to the use. For example, a development environment can be very much scaled down compared to staging or production environments.<br><br><strong>Testing</strong><br>The next phase is testing which once again is broken down into several steps including unit test (usually the responsibility of the developers), integration testing (which may be automated), performance testing (which is often scripted but requires staff intervention in the interpretation of results) and user acceptance testing (or UAT) where a team of users carries out a number of tests as close to real world use as possible.<br><br><strong>Training and Transition</strong><br>The next phase is testing which once again is broken down into several steps including unit test (usually the responsibility of the developers), integration testing (which may be automated), performance testing (which is often scripted but requires staff intervention in the interpretation of results) and user acceptance testing (or UAT) where a team of users carries out a number of tests as close to real world use as possible.<br><br><strong>Operations and Maintenance</strong><br>The operations and maintenance phase involves a transition from hypercare to normal operation, the so-called BAU (business as usual). In this phase, the usual business operations and maintenance teams take over the day to day operations, usually after a handover period from the development team. Existing processes are updated and operational use ratified.<br><br><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>The final phase is evaluation where the new system is evaluated by the users against a number of criteria including ease of use, uptake, efficiency, system performance and reliability.  This can lead to follow up programs that may provide enhancements, improvements and bug fixes.<br><br><strong><u>READING</u></strong><br><br>Rumbaugh, J. Ralston, A., &amp; Reilly, E.

Qualitative methods are beneficial to the study where known a priori theories that include quantitative methods are not effective enough to measure the high contextual environment or the high degree of uncertainty (Trauth, 2001, as cited in Spears &amp; Baraki, 2010: 506).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Quantitative methods apply the theoretical model to examine hypotheses derived from the researchers' knowledge and the interpretive (ostensibly qualitative) (Gable, 1994) understanding developed with hermeneutics and participation-observation (Lee, 1991). Hence, it is beneficial to combine both qualitative and quantitative methods to include context into the research and validate testability (Kalpan &amp; Duchon, 1988).</div><div><br></div><div>Spears &amp; Baraki (2010) applied the qualitative approach to establish five variables of a research model of user participation in security risk management (SRM): user participation, organisational awareness, business-aligned SRM, control development, and control performance. They found that qualitative studies contributed to validating content to test the research model during quantitative analysis, regardless of its time-consuming nature.</div><div><br></div><div>Advantages of User Participation in the Risk Management Process</div><div><br></div><div>The authors listed two advantages of user participation in the risk management process. First, organisational security controls such as policies, procedures, and countermeasures, are effective when user awareness against them exists. Second, user participation provides a business context that contributes to establishing more effective security controls.</div><div><br></div><div>Research Findings</div><div><br></div><div>The study remarked that the low response rate obtained to the questionnaire survey potentially led to non-response bias (Spears &amp; Baraki, 2010), affecting the risk assessment when I will engage. Hill et al. (1997) identified "statistically significant differences between responders and non-responders". They also observed that a practical approach against non-responders is to follow up with a different contact approach, which was not feasible by the authors (Spears &amp; Baraki, 2010). As the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods enhances the robustness of results strengthened using triangulation with the cross-validation (Kalpan &amp; Duchon, 1988), it is worth applying both paradigms to the upcoming assessment with the combination of following up with a different contact approach against non-responders to mitigate the non-response bias. However, having different paradigms with multiple following-ups is time-consuming. Hence, this approach is applied when resources are not limited.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>References:</div><div><br></div><div>Gable, G. G.
