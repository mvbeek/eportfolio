                    Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</strong><br><br>Compromising a Medical Mannequin, Discuss the major threats and vulnerabilities in the paper, and how to mitigate against these?<br><br>These are my peers Initial posts and my response's. (respond to two peer posts)<br><br><strong>Muhammad Nasim Akbary</strong><br><strong>Initial Post: Vulnerabilities and Mitigations</strong><br><br><div>Unfortunately, I won't be able to keep this discussion very in-depth and detailed due to the word count limit, but I would like to explain some common vulnerabilities that could be found in the Medical systems and mitigation options.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Common flaws in the physical design</u></div><div>1. Unsecured server room, unsecured digital storage devices such as portable USB drives, backup tapes/drives, unsecured sensitive printed information and so on. Mitigation: This risk can be mitigated by keeping the servers always in an appropriate and secured room, only accessed by specific and responsible personnel, the server room should be monitored by security cameras and motion detection sensors to detect any forcibly and unauthorized break-ins. The digital storage devices and printed data must be stored in secured drawers and rooms.</div><div>2. Exposed Personal Identifiable Information, Personal Health Information, Personal Credit Card Information and such. Mitigation: Any PII, PHI, PCI or any other sensitive data available in hard-copies must be stored in secured drawers and rooms as explained above.</div><div>3. User computers left unlocked, logged-on and unattended. Mitigation: Policies must be enforced to users to lock their computers and do not leave any digitally stored or printed data unsecured and unattended. A policy to enforce computer session-lock if left inactive can also be pushed to end devices by System Administrators using Endpoint Management Systems and so.</div><div>4. User's and System Administrator's clearance and access level. Mitigation: Incorrectly assigned clearance level, access cards can result in the breach of security and theft of sensitive information, so planning and assigning access as per need and role would be suggested. Always start by lock-everything and access what is REQUIRED concept and provide security/access clearance as per requirement.</div><div>5. Unauthorized access of network ports. Mitigation: Shutdown or keep all unused network ports disconnected from the network switches to avoid unauthorized network access.<br><br></div><div><u>Some examples of exposure through the network</u></div><div>1. Exposures through vulnerability found in the Operating Systems or Applications. Mitigation: Keeping Operating Systems and Applications up to date with security patches is the key to keep up with this issue. Avoiding the use of end-of-life OS and Apps are also crucial.</div><div>2. Vulnerabilities found in incorrect or missing configuration in systems such as in Database servers, Database Management Systems (DBMS) and Web servers. Mitigation: SQL injection is a very common way of attacks against database and database servers, using Django and Python frameworks to secure the DB could be an example of mitigation against SQL injection threat. Avoiding the use of password hashes, properly assigned access to DBMS and equipping Web servers with capabilities to fight against threats such as Cross Site Request Forgery are other examples that could help mitigate the said challenges.</div><div>3. Bruteforce against user passwords and attacks in general used against known account names such as "admin or administrator". Mitigation: Implementing policies to only allow complex and at least more than 8 character passwords, renaming or disabling commonly used administrative account names are examples of mitigation options.</div><div>4. Attacks through email. Mitigation: According to CISA's report (cisa.gov, 2020), more than 65% of attacks through emails took place successfully against users. Putting in place measures to scan emails and filter out illegitimate, infected or malicious emails prior reaching user's inbox is the way to fight against cyber threats through email.</div><div>5. Attacks against Wireless Access Points and networks in general. Mitigation: Do not use out of data Wireless Security Protocols such as WEP, use WPA-Enterprise highly recommended or at least WPA2 with strong-long-complex passphrase and schedule changing the passphrase at least every 3-6 months. Where possible, hide your SSID. Use Firewall and allow only required ports at least for incoming network traffic, where possible, apply the rule to allow required ports for outgoing traffic as well.</div><div>6. Attacks against end devices. Mitigation: Always secure end devices with Antivirus/Antispyware/Antimalware protection tools, where possible, use end device Firewall and allow only required incoming network traffic. Implement and use VPN for end devices if the end user travels and accesses the organization's network/apps over public/unsecure internet.</div><div>7. And I would never leave user awareness out of any list of security risk mitigation. As Cyber Security nowadays takes a village. Everyone should be responsible in securing their personal and an organization's data.</div><div>In conclusion, keeping aligned with the CIA triad is the key 'as the name says' to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the data.</div><div><br></div><div>References:</div><div><br></div><div>French, K.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Nasim, an interesting post, you list a good number of points. Of particular interest is the mention about the CIA triad, as this protects a company’s compliance, ensures continuity and protects the reputation of an organization (Logsign.com, 2019). My only critique would be that there is no clear answer to the question asked about the medical mannequin and what mitigation steps could be put in place. What are your thoughts on protecting Wi-Fi of medical devices from hackers?<br><br>According to Alpine Security (2018) hacked medical devices may be the next big security nightmare. In 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled over 460 000 pacemakers because they were vulnerable to attack. According to the FDA the vulnerability could enable hackers to remotely drain the batteries or cause the device to run at dangerously high speeds. Interesting the idea behind a pacemaker been hacked was from a TV show called Homeland filmed in 2012. After the TV show in 2013 former US vice president Dick Chaney had the wireless capabilities of his pacemaker disabled because of fears that his life would be at risk if his pacemaker was hacked (Best, 2020). It would appear that there needs to be more focus on securing medical devices going forward, potentially from the inception of a medical device all the way through its life cycle.<br><br>References:<br><br>Logsign.com, (2019) What is the CIA triad and why is it important for cybersecurity?&nbsp; Available from Logsign.com website: https://www.logsign.com/blog/what-is-the-cia-triad-and-why-is-it-important-for-cybersecurity/&nbsp;(Accessed August 21, 2021)<br><br>Alpinesecurity.com, (2018) Most dangerous hacked medical devices, Available from Alpinesecurity.com website: https://alpinesecurity.com/blog/most-dangerous-hacked-medical-devices/&nbsp;(Accessed August 21, 2021)<br><br>Best, J.

Medical training devices are not excluded from these threats. As they are depending on technology. According to the U.S food and drug administration, these medical training devices are exposed to cybersecurity breaches. However, there’s no serious situation recorded that were a result of these breaches, I mean no death or injuries happened as a result of the cybersecurity breaches. (Wang et al. 2020)</div></div><div><br></div><div>One of the common attacks that might exploit the mannequin system which is discussed in the paper is the brute force attack, first, we need to understand the concept of the brute force attack. It is a mechanism in which the attacker uses a different combination of keys to get into the system, a result of a successful attack will allow the attacker to get authorized access to the system. An effective method to prevent a brute force attack is to use a strong pair of keys for cryptography, in which it restrains the malicious actor’s ability to use a large key space to lunch a brute force attack. (Tahir et al. 2013)</div><div><br></div><div>The mannequin system is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack (DOS), according to Kesidis et al. Dos attacks are the attacks when the malicious actor block legitimate users to access the information technology devices, which affects the availably of these resources. Lin2013 discussed the point to mitigate the risks of Dos attacks Security professionals must detect the attack first, it can be done in many ways:</div><div><br></div><div>1-      Vulnerability Dos: Examining the packet header values.</div><div><br></div><div>2-      Flood Dos: Using statistical measures to observe a large number of packets.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; References</div><div><br></div><div>Glisson, w.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Mahamad, a great initial post. I particularly enjoyed your explanations of both the brute force attack as well as the denial-of-service attack and how they relate to the medical mannequin. A critique would be that perhaps a way of preventing the attack from been exploited would be to prevent the hackers from gaining access wirelessly to the mannequin. How would you prevent the Wi-Fi of the medical device from been breached?<br><br>Of interest is the focus and reason behind hacking of medical devices. According to Best (2020), virtually all medical devices can be hacked as most have to have a way to communicate outside of the body. A large majority of medical devices now communicate wirelessly so medical personal can gather data and monitor patients, alternatively the patient can also monitor their own progress using an app. Best (2020) also mentions no patients have come to harm or at least know has been reported. The main reason behind hacking of medical devices is to steal PHI and PII (Espinosa, 2021). Let’s hope new laws come into play so manufactures are responsible for maintaining the security of the devices before anyone gets in harms way.<br><br><br>References:<br><br>Best, J. (2020).
