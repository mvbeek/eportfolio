(2016) Information security management needs more holistic approach: A literature review. International Journal of Information Management 36(2): 215-225.<br><br><strong>ePortfolio<br></strong>https://mvbeek.github.io/eportfolio/<br><br><br><strong><u>End of Module Assignment: Refection of the NISM process</u></strong><br><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>This Network and Information Security Management (NISM) module has incorporated several different and interesting approaches to learning. This has included Lecture casts (pre-recorded videos which included interactive clicks), which were summarised in knowledge-based tests and focused reading. Live seminars every three weeks were tutor hosted and centered on current case studies. A major component was also group work assignments as well as designing and programming a large e-portfolio, a personal learning and development website used to critically assess and reflect on academic work. It is apparent that there are many different network and security management processes, these encompass a huge spectrum of frameworks from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and much more. NISM could be considered as an all-encompassing term for cyber security, information assurance, computer security and information security.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Module learning outcomes have been wide and varied in scope, some of which are covered below. Data protection standards are one example, such as GDPR, a privacy standard set in the EU protecting the personal information of individuals. It exists to help private citizens, ensuring their personal information is only used if or when consent is given, critically by ‘opting in’. ISO 27001 is another standard used globally as a reliable way to manage information security through the business management lifecycle. Implementing ISO 27001 shows a business is actively reducing the risk of cyber security threats and can provide a competitive advantage. Similarly, two other standards which focus primarily on continual service improvement, managing risk and security compliance are; the Control Objectives for IT (COBIT) and The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). Confidentiality Integrity and Availability (CIA) outlines guidance on the development of security policies and how data should be protected.</div><br><div>
</div><div>In another field, further learning focused on the use of vulnerability tools and testing, how a corporation can assess their vulnerability status to establish where threats are present and what the risks involved are. Penetrating (Pen) Testing is often used in conjunction with vulnerability testing. Pen testers are essentially white hat hackers, employed to hack into systems in live scenarios, providing insight into establishing where breaches are able to occur. Companies should (ideally) then close those entry points as a result and mitigate any damage caused.</div><br><div>
</div><div>It’s apparent that a large part of NISM is very much related to highlighting the importance of networks and network security, ranging from physical hardware to virtual appliances. It’s essential to quantify risk and establish measures which are achievable in mitigating that risk. The topic of network scanning and vulnerability testing tools was, in fact, of particular interest. It appears obvious now that Pen Testing and Vulnerability Scans should be used frequently in almost all businesses globally and be part of the business continuity plan. Another example that resonated was the Security Standards section which primarily focused on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This unit included case studies based on specific areas of GDPR, this was well covered in the collaborative learning discussions.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Although these seminars were generally insightful, unfortunately they are held at a time during the day which made it not possible to attend live on Eastern Standard Time. The recorded sessions were however reviewable at a later date and more convenient time. Another note, that all deadlines for the module were based on GMT, which essentially makes the requirement for submission one day earlier for those in the Americas, compared to that of their peers. Considering a user capacity, navigating through the UOE web platform can in itself be quite challenging, especially finding academic reading material and papers pertaining to certain subject matter.</div><br><div>
</div><div>As pertains group work, within the group assignments it was interesting to understand your peers’ thoughts and input on the topics covered. However, working in a team came with its own challenges, half of the team being located in the UK and the other half across the Atlantic meant a 7 hour difference in time zones. The main difficulty was communication and a few team members being very last minute in submitting sections of work to the group for review. One team member also dropped out halfway through the module, unfortunately we were not informed by the university and as a result handed in one assignment as a late submission.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Overall, the NISM module was extremely interesting and insightful. There were a number of difficulties with the learning platform and group assignments, but overall, this was a good learning experience. The module provided valuable insight into the world of cybersecurity, ranging from an introduction of local area networks to vulnerability and penetration tools. With consideration to practical application, incorporating security standards in a professional capacity could improve security governance, business continuity, compliance, and aid in continual service improvement. Standards are enforced by law to protect the privacy of citizens and ultimately give back control protecting personal identifiable information.
