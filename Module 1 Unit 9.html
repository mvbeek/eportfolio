The details of the business problem are as follows:</div><div><br></div><div>Queens medical centre is a community clinic and serves as the first point of call for any resident within the catchment area who happens to be unwell. The clinic has specialists in various areas of medicine. However, an appointment is required to schedule a consultation meeting with a specialist, which is done through a telephone call to the receptionist.</div><div><br></div><div>The clinic has been experiencing a high volume of calls, causing a lot of problems for residents to get access to care on time. Also, the management of Queens medical centre needs to plan to be able to respond to the rate of growth of the community population.</div><div><br></div><div>To address this problem, the clinic management has decided to acquire a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS). This will allow appointments to be booked online by prospective patients. The system will collect vital information from the patient to be able to determine which specialist is best to attend to a given case, considering the availability and workload of the specialist doctor.</div><div><br></div><div>The management of the clinic is concerned about the recent high rate of cybercrime and the government's policy on patient data protection.

</div><div><strong>1.	Introduction
</strong><br><br></div><div>This report will advise on the potential cyber threats of a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS) and how these can be mitigated. The report is broken down into three sections: benefits of ASMIS, diagrams for threat modeling, followed by security technologies.
</div><div>Medical appointments traditionally, have been made telephonically or in person and then manually entered into a scheduler system. A scheduler system can be managed in paper form or electronically as a software installed on one’s computer system with a database stored locally. Both the above methods require someone to be physically available to answer the phone and take appointment bookings. Large call volumes and the human intervention required could result in a decrease in customer satisfaction as well as patients not being seen to in a timely manner (Zhao, et al. 2017). 
<br><br></div><div>This forms the basis in reasoning for utilizing an automated ASMIS which is thought to increase productivity, efficiency and the quality of service received by patients. There are both benefits and risks of implementing such systems, both of which are analyzed below.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.1	Benefits of ASMIS and potential problems including cyber threats to the system</strong></div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>The introduction of ASMIS could reduce operational costs while improving the quality of service (Akinode, J.L, Oloruntoba, S.A., 2017). Using appointments to schedule clients is a way of cutting down waiting times, prioritizing appointments, and optimizing utilization of resources within the system. Other scheduling benefits to the healthcare providers are; arrival flow, less customer footfall on premises, improved staff efficiency and less pressure on staff (Thamrin, 2020). Usually, ASMIS is used to plan meetings between patients, facilities, and providers (Akinode, J.L, Oloruntoba, S.A., 2017).  There have been considerable surveys regarding customer satisfaction, these have typically found that the most important feature of online scheduling is the ability to change appointments at any time and shows that the majority of patients would choose to use such a service again (Zhao, et al. 2017). 
<br><br></div><div>Two of the most popular web-based ASMIS systems used today are Software as a Service (SaaS) and on-premise web-based scheduling systems. SaaS is an online cloud-based offering and can be linked to a health care providers own internal scheduling systems (Zhao, et al. 2017). SaaS has many benefits such as increased security, data storage, analytics, scalability, cost effectiveness, operational manageability as well as accessibility. SaaS also incurs its own challenges for example the loss of control, limited customization, slow speed and security risks. SaaS does however require reliable and strong internet connectivity which may result in higher monthly expenses (Comptia, 2020). The other type of appointment service to be considered is a locally hosted web system, which is integrated into the database portals on a provider's website (Zhao, et al. 2017). Benefits to locally hosted environments are the ability to ensure more control over the environment, ownership of the product, full data access and the ability to build the system specifically to meet your business requirements. There are also some negative aspects to consider when owning and operating your own hosted systems. These would encompass for example, the hands-on nature of building a hosted environment, a high initial upfront cost, recurring maintenance requirements, difficulties in scaling up, additionally the increased time and resources that are required for security implementation (Nyorani, 2020).</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>One crucial thing to consider here is that “a critical approach to defending the organization’s software infrastructure is anticipating the nature of the exploits from the attacker’s perspective before they occur, and strategizing mitigation plans in order to prevent these attacks from being successful. This is called Threat Modeling” (ResearchGate, 2015).</div></div><br><div><div> 
</div><div><strong>1.2	UML diagrams providing modeling techniques to identify and mitigate potential threats</strong></div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>UML diagrams are effectively flow charts showcasing how data is processed. “The UML is an industry standard for object-oriented software engineering” (Dobing and Parsons, 2008). UML diagrams can be used to clearly identify and layout threat modeling techniques. “There are six main methodologies you can use while threat modeling—STRIDE, PASTA, CVSS, attack trees, Security Cards, and hTMM. Each of these methodologies provides a different way to assess the threats facing your IT assets” (Exabeam, 2020).
</div><div>Initially it is important to lay out the benefits of creating a system which establishes risk in general; “threat Modelling (TM) is a process during which specific potential security vulnerabilities and their associated risks are identified, so that they can be addressed in a targeted manner. It is a mechanism to evaluate controls, system security and a key task for developing secure applications. TM creates and formalises a process that identifies threats and analyses the vulnerabilities of an individual or combination of Information and communications technology (ICT) assets. By modelling threats, our aim is to be proactive in identifying, classifying and describing them, to enable the visibility of an attack or a campaign of attacks” (Tatam et al., 2021). 
</div><div>The diagram below represented as figure one, is a UML flow diagram showcasing how a user would interact with the ASMIS software. As it pertains to this report, figure one establishes the process that a patient or Doctor would follow to register or login to the systems and perform various functions, specifically booking an appointment with a Doctor.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Figure 1: UML Flow Diagram - Registration and booking using ASMIS system (see bottom of page)</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>In the second UML flow diagram below it can be seen the type of commands a Doctor and Patient would have available to them whilst accessing the ASMIS system.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Figure 2: UML Flow Diagram - Patient and Doctor Interactions (see bottom of page)</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>The below diagrams (figures three and four) are being included bearing in mind that “to proactively deal with security issues of enterprise systems, threat modeling is one approach that includes identifying the main assets within a system and threats to these assets. It is used to both assess the current state of a system and as a security-by-design tool for developing new systems. The approach can be coupled with attack simulations to provide probabilistic evaluations of security, e.g., time to compromise (TTC). On the basis of such objective evaluations, security controls can be chosen to counter anticipated threats” (Xiong et al., 2021). For the ASMIS system discussed the popular STRIDE threat model would complement one’s strategy. STRIDE uses “six broad categories of threats. These threat categories include Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege” (Hussain, et al. 2014).</div></div><br><div><div>

</div><div><strong>1.3	Cyber security technologies that can be used to address the bookings problem</strong></div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Incorporating technology into the health field is leading to a greater level of precision in medicine; however, cybersecurity measures must still be improved. Since 2010, data breaches in the healthcare sector have increased exponentially and it is now one of the most targeted industries by cyber criminals (Argaw, et al. 2020). Due to the nature of the accumulation of private healthcare data one can imagine why this information is sought out by cyber criminals. When the UK’s National Health System (NHS) hospitals were hit with WannaCry ransomware in May 2017, treatment plans were delayed, and even incoming ambulances were rerouted due to loss of access to hospital technology (Argaw, et al. 2020). In 2018 The South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority in Norway reported that the PHI for more than half the country’s population had been compromised. The main vulnerability was related to unpatched and outdated legacy systems. Many healthcare providers still make use of legacy devices as the medical software used is no longer supported in newer operating systems. A regional hospital in Hancock America was hit with a ransomware attack in 2018 which corrupted medical record files. The hackers demanded $55,000 which was in fact paid by the hospital. It was later discovered that the hackers used a Microsoft remote desktop protocol with default credentials to gain access (Argaw, et al. 2020). As cyber-attacks become more frequent it is imperative “a health facility to have a strong information security posture” (Argaw, et al. 2020). No longer can we avoid the reality of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, the benefits of risk mitigation include reduced litigation costs, fewer lawsuits, and less reputational damage (Hinder, et al. 2019).</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>All healthcare providers hold personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) for their patients in either electronic format or physical documents. As a healthcare providers store this type of information, they are required by law to protect this sensitive data. In the UK patient data must be protected and handled by the Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the Common Law Duty of Confidentiality (CLDC) (NHS Digital, 2018). For the storing, recording, and processing of personal data both DPA and GDPR requires that the two articles six and eight respectively are met. The basic guideline for a patient is to give consent to the healthcare provider to store and protect your PII and PHI with the option of freely removing your information at anytime (NHS Digital, 2018).</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Considering the above, one can see how the health industry is heavily targeted by cyber criminals. These attacks are lucrative for the hackers and the impact to the healthcare provider can be unrepairable (Argaw, et al. 2020). It is essential to secure the PHI of patient while following governmental data protection guidelines. Data protection compliance can be successfully implemented by using security technologies. There are a number of security technologies that can be implemented to secure an on-premise environment as well a cloud based environment relating to the ASMIS software. Following are some recommended security technologies and a brief description of each. It’s important to remember that all security technologies have benefits as well as draw backs. Every environment is unique and will require a bespoke approach.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Firstly, multifactor authentication (MFA), which is a widely used security technology, known as an electronic authentication method. This method enables users to gain access to a website or application by using the traditional username-password format. It follows by providing a one-time code presented to the user via mobile or email (B. O. ALSaleem and A. I. Alshoshan, 2021). MFA is one of the aspects that have become a standard in our lives in fact. The reason why that is so important to us and our networks is that credentials can easily be leaked and according to Okta.com. (2021) “cybercriminals have more than 15 billion stolen credentials” while multi factor authentication ads a new layer of security to an already compromised account.
</div><div>Secondly, a network monitoring system, which is highly effective in protecting your local area network from cyberattacks, this continuously tracks the flow of traffic in a network. The challenge with network monitoring is the vast amount of data it generates. However, Cisco Systems Inc, (2021) highlight how Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) solves this problem.</div></div><br><div><div> 
</div><div>Network monitoring encompasses two technologies, firstly an Intrusion detection system (IDS), which is a software or a hardware that is installed to monitor the traffic in the network. This finds and detects unwanted traffic, events and activities, moreover, it can store event logs to be reviewed at a later date. Notifying administrators of the most critical events that are detected, recording information related to the events and producing reports are the main functions performed by the IDS (Hattarki, Houji, Dhage, 2021). Secondly an Intrusion prevention system (IPS), which is a technology used to perform both functions, detecting threats as well as intrusions into the system or the network and managing the responsive actions to these detected threats. IPS monitor malicious traffic at real time generate alerts regarding these traffic as well as it can drop it or block it from the network. If an attack is active, IPS would be the countermeasure to stop that attack. The main functionalities performed by IPS include detection and prevention against malicious activities, stopping the attack, changing attack’s content, and altering the security environment (Hattarki, Houji, Dhage, 2021).</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div><strong>1.4	 Conclusion</strong></div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>As highlighted by Gräßler et al. (2020) “Faults in the realization and usage of cyber-physical systems can cause significant security issues… security-oriented fault-tolerance in Systems Engineering (SE) requires measures to evaluate interdisciplinary system designs with regard to potential scenarios of attacks”. However, Al-Mohannadi et al. (2016) notes that “Proper utilisation of attack modelling techniques provide advance planning, which can be implemented rapidly during an ongoing attack event”.
</div><div>When considering the two different ASMIS systems considered in this report it would be advisable to recommend SaaS. This is in main because of the program’s security aspects, flexibility, and cost effectiveness. However as discussed, hosting ASMIS in-house will require a large initial investment. As cyber threats evolve it is key that we do our utmost to be able to detect and prevent any breaches using all the security tools and emerging technologies at our disposal.
</div><div>Essentially cyber security alone will not solve this clinics problem, as the main issue remains the residents being unable to obtain appointments in a timely manner. However, cyber security can and will play a major part in securing the ASMIS system which will enable appointments to be made by locals in a much more efficient and successful way.</div></div><br><div><div>
