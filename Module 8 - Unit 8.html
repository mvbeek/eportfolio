                    <strong><br></strong><br><strong>Module 8 - Unit 8</strong><br><br><strong>Inferential Statistics</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><br><div>Week 8, an introduction into the different analyses available for the different types of quantitative data. This will mean looking at ways to describe your data and how to create and perform hypothesis tests. This is called inference, as we are making inferences about a population from a sample of data. Inference is the process of extracting meaningful and useful business information from raw data. This process is known as statistical inference, because it involves using the data to make valid inferences about the underlying population. As data is inherently variable, all such inferences will necessarily be subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty is quantified using probability.</div><div><br></div><div>Data consist of the observed values of one or more variables of interest. They are usually organised into datasets. A dataset can be thought of as a table, whose columns represent the different variables, and whose rows represent the individual observations. Each individual cell in the table contains the value that the variable takes for the given observation.</div><div><br></div><div>In order to extract meaningful and useful business intelligence from data, it is important that the methodology to be employed is valid for the variable or variables of interest. The first important distinction concerns the level of measurement of each variable.</div><div><br></div><div>When exploring data, it is helpful to try to summarise the data in some meaningful way. One approach is to construct a graphical summary. In this section, we (very briefly) explore some of the more useful graphical summaries.</div><div><br></div><div>It is often convenient to summarise numerical data using a few simple summary measures. Most commonly, two such measures are used. The first of these is a measure of location, and represents the value taken by “a typical observation” – that is, by an observation that falls “right in the middle of the data”. As well as knowing the magnitude of a typical observation, some idea of the “variability” or “spread” of the data is also useful. This is provided by a measure of dispersion.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of estimating some population value of interest that underlies the data, an alternative form of inference is to use the data to provide evidence about whether some assumption of interest regarding that population value is likely to be true. Such a form of inference is known as hypothesis testing and is usually preferred to the estimation approach when interest lies in comparing the relevant values underlying two or more different populations.</div><div><br></div><div>These are all techniques we can employ to find patterns and meaning from our data.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>In this unit we shall:<br><br></strong></div><div>- Define the different levels of quantitative data.</div><div>- Define measures of location and spread.</div><div>- Introduce the concept of inference and hypothesis testing.<br><br></div><div><strong>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</strong></div><div><br>- Identify the different levels of measurement.</div><div>- Produce measures of location and spread.</div><div>- Perform appropriate hypothesis tests.</div><div><strong><u><br>LECTURECAST</u><br></strong></div><br><div><strong>Summary Measures and Inference</strong><br><br>Numerical data is often summarised to help with the understanding of the data without having to look through all the data points.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Two measures are commonly used:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>1) Location, the value taken by a typical observation</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">2)Dispersion, which gives some idea of how spread out the data is<br></span><br><strong>Inference</strong></div><div>In general, population values such as the mean, represent unknown (in fact, unknowable) quantities whose values may be of great&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">practical interest. The best we can do, therefore, is to use data sampled from the relevant population to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">make inferences concerning these unknowable population values.<br><br></span></div><div>Statistical inference takes two forms. The first is concerned with using the data to estimate some underlying population value such&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">as the population mean.<br><br></span></div><div>The second form of inference is concerned with using the data to investigate whether some assumption of interest regarding the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">underlying population is likely to be true. Such a process is known as hypothesis testing. The uncertainty present in the data is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">accounted for in hypothesis testing by considering the probability that any conclusion reached is incorrect.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></div><div></div><div><div><br><strong>PEER REVIEWS (1 of 3)</strong><br><br>Respond to at least three of your peers’ contributions from Unit 7, limit your posts to 200-300 words maximum.</div><div><br>Agne Angelides<br><strong>Initial Post<br></strong><br>Abi, a researcher and a statistical programmer at an institute, has been assigned a project to evaluate a nutritional value of a new cereal (Whizzz) produced by their manufacturing client. The data collected, however, does not support nor deny the clients claims regarding the nutrition, i.e. the results are inconclusive. For the purpose of this post, it is assumed that the institute is the UK based.</div><div><br></div><div>The data analysis has always been subjective as it is based on the researcher’s views, and it is not uncommon for different researchers to arrive at different results whilst analysing the same set of data (Farrimond, 2013). Hence, if the data does not provide conclusive evidence which supports the client’s claims, the report should include all results regardless of the manufacturer’s expectations: negative, positive and inconclusive. Also, the researcher’s affiliations should be included too, so that the report readers can be made aware of any potential biases (Kaplan &amp; Maxwell, 2005).</div><div><br></div><div>The UK Research Integrity Office Code of Practice for Research (2022) advises that if the researcher suspects the misinterpretation or misuse of their results is likely, it should be reported to an appropriate person within their organisation. In this instance, there should be policies within the institute to assist Abi with this ethical conundrum whilst also ensuring they are not violating any client agreements. Similarly, the European Science Foundation (2011) Code of Conduct for Research integrity, point 1.2 is expecting impartial and accurate data publications.</div><div><br></div><div>Abi should also consider the professional code of conducts applicable to Information Technology specialists, such as the BCS Code of Conduct (2022). By emitting unfavourable results, Abi would violate the Public interest section of this code by potentially endangering the general population. Further repercussions on Abi’s professional credibility are also very likely.</div><div><br></div><div>Whilst the ethical codes of conduct are important to consider when deciding on the action plan, the legal implications must also be understood. Since the research is being done on a food product, the key legislations in the UK such as the Food Standards Act 1999 and Food Safety Act 1990 (Food standards Agency, 2022) would apply here. Abi should not withhold the results from the client even if there is a suspicion the client may only promote the favourable results. However, if the client goes ahead and only uses the favourable results as the nutritional product value, they would be in violation of the laws safeguarding the consumers’ health such as those above.</div><div><br></div><div>As an employee of a business with an ultimate goal of pleasing your client, it may be difficult to navigate the ethical waters. However, the research industry has a moral and ethical obligation of not causing any harm to people, and this is what the decision should be based on. That said, Abi should not be left alone to deal with this situation and research organisations must provide the necessary support.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>References</strong></div><div><br></div><div>BCS (2022) CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BCS MEMBERS.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Agne, you have done exceptionally well by comprehensively discussing the ethical implications of Abi's actions. In the introduction, you summarized the ethical problem and emphasized that Abi's research results on the new cereal (Whizz) are inconclusive.
<br><br>In the next paragraph, you highlight that data analysis is subjective - a vital point supported by a reference. Indeed, analysis of the same data set by different researchers may lead to unique conclusions. Researchers must include all results regardless of the manufacturer's positive or negative expectations. Fabricating, omitting, or falsifying data violates the integrity principle of scientific research (Weinbaum et al., 2019). 
<br><br>Moreover, it is interesting how you have integrated applicable research policies by the UK Research Integrity Office Code of Practice for Research. A piece of advice highlighted recommends that if researchers misinterpret results, such actions should be reported to the appropriate entities. You have also advised the need to consider applicable policies for Information Technology specialists, such as the BCS Code of Conduct. Is the process of reporting such actions transparent? How will Abi's professional credibility be affected by the decision to omit unfavorable results?
<br><br>Finally, you have innovatively integrated key legislations applicable to food products in the UK, such as the Food Standard Act of 1999 and the Food Safety Act of 1990. I have two questions that need clarity. Firstly, what are the possible legal implications for the manufacturer's actions to omit unfavorable results? How can customers react to such unscrupulous actions by manufacturers, especially if the product causes detrimental effects on their health? I think answering such questions will provide a solid foundation to understand the ethical and legal implications of omitting unfavorable results about the product's nutritional value.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Richard, you have done well in providing a brief response to the ethical issues involving Abi and the manufacturer of the new cereal (Whizz). The emphasis is that the nutritional values of the product are harmful. 
<br><br>Richard, you claim that Abi must provide both negative and positive analyses. You have argued that providing the positive and negative analysis ensures that the data presented is valid and reliable. However, an issue noted is the use of references with no publication dates. The publication date is vital when determining the credibility of a source. Recently published sources are credible and updated. Are researchers obligated to provide negative and positive results analyses? I recommend that you review more credible sources to strengthen this argument. You might want to check the ten principles for scientific research recommended by Weinbaum et al. (2019). 
<br><br>I agree that researchers are not responsible professionally for what others do with the results. However, they are ethically responsible to whistle blow when needed. You have done well to support this claim using the British Computing Society Code of Conduct. The code emphasizes the need for public health, privacy, security, and the welfare of others. 
<br><br>I have two simple questions. First, in your opinion, is the process of raising concerns with managers or from the Equality and Human Rights Commission transparent and straightforward? Indeed, the publication of unfavorable results would violate the public interest. However, I think you can bolster your argument by highlighting specific laws and regulations applicable to such situations. What prescriptions by bodies such as the Food Standard Agency can address such ethical concerns?

Ethically, he is obligated to present both positive and negative analyses to satisfy the requirements of the profession. According to the European Science Foundation (2011), research integrity demands that individuals demonstrate honesty in communication, objectivity, and transparency, and openness and accessibility. Accordingly, Abi must present both sides of the analysis to maintain these elements of research integrity. The importance of presenting both positive and negative analyses is evident in the BCS Code of Conduct which stresses that researchers have to protect public health and the well-being of individuals and the environment (BCS 2022). The failure to reveal the negative analyses would be a violation of the code since the consumption of the cereal could affect people's health.</div><div><br></div><div>Abi has analyzed the cereal and discovered both positive and negative implications of its consumption, but he cannot be responsible for the use to which others put his results. Farrimond (2013) contends that researchers often gather and analyze information and present it to ethics committees that determine the use of the information. Accordingly, researchers cannot be held liable for the way others use their results as long as they present accurate findings that demonstrate both positive and negative implications. However, researchers cannot overlook their responsibility to maintain the accuracy of their findings, for example, by discussing the results in public forums. They cannot support the position of the users of the results because it would be a violation of regulations. For example, the Food Safety Act of 1990 highlights the significance of ensuring that organizations serve or sell food in the nature, quality, and substance that consumers expect (Food Standards Agency 2022). Abi is not responsible for the use to which others put the results, but he cannot support their presentation of the outcomes if they violate regulations and codes of conduct.</div><div><br></div><div>Abi should present both the positive and negative results of the analyses, but the manufacturer is likely to publicize the positive ones and ignore the negative outcomes. In such a case, Abi has several courses of action. He can present the findings of his analyses to food safety authorities to ensure the public understands the health implications of Whizz. According to the UK Research Integrity Office (2021), researchers must accept their responsibility to publish and disseminate research in ways that report their investigations and present findings accurately without selection that can be misleading. Therefore, Abi has to share the findings of his analyses with food safety authorities through the publication and dissemination of the information. Abi can recommend qualitative research that involves examining the health implications of consuming Whizzy. In this case, the goal is to underscore his results that the company may refute after he disseminates the information. Qualitative research can be helpful in situations where the subject involves more dynamic processes than static qualities (Kaplan and Maxwell 2005). The company could argue its decision to publicize the positive analyses while ignoring the negative outcomes was based on its belief that the negative results did not offer a robust justification for its publication. Faced with this situation, Abi should recommend qualitative analyses of consumers of the product to verify his findings. The goal is to ensure he maintains his ethical obligation of presenting accurate and reliable findings to the public.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>References</strong></div><div><br></div><div>BCS (2022) CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BCS MEMBERS.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Ali, you have provided an indisputably comprehensive discussion on the ethical implications of Abi and the manufacturer's actions. I find it interesting how you incorporated the recommendations of the European Science Foundation on the integrity demands of research, mainly honesty, transparency, and openness. You have also innovatively integrated the BCS Code of Conduct recommendations, specifying the need for research to secure public health and well-being. I agree that omitting some results violates the code because consuming unhealthy Whizz will jeopardize consumers' health.
<br><br>Secondly, I agree that researchers should not be held accountable for the findings. However, researchers are ethically responsible for providing accurate positive or negative findings. Researchers should honestly report research results and avoid fabricating or falsifying results (Salwén, 2021). You have raised a critical issue here regarding the responsibility of researchers to maintain the accuracy of their findings. I would like to know if there is a specific policy in the UK stipulating the procedures for maintaining research accuracy. 
<br><br>Moreover, you have innovatively introduced the idea of Abi reporting the findings to food safety authorities for the public to understand. Is there a specific procedure for researchers such as Abi to securely report such findings to the food authorities? What are the possible implications of such an action on the principles of scientific research, like the conflict of interest, professional competence, and professional discipline?
<br><br>Finally, you have also raised a fundamental issue regarding the manufacturer's justification for publishing only the positive nutritional values of the product. You have stated that the manufacturer can claim a lack of robust justification to publish the negative results. If this was to be done, what would be the implications considering the principles of duty to society, conflict of interest, and beneficence? I think including such issues provides a robust foundation to comprehend the ethical implications from both the research and manufacturer's perspectives.
