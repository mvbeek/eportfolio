This assignment counts towards 40% of the overall module mark.<br><br>2000 words<br><br><strong><u>Executive Summary of a Network and Information Security Management (NISM) Assessment</u></strong><br><br><div>We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the organisation's security environment through vulnerability scanning and penetration testing with a GDPR focused lens. The website scanned for vulnerabilities, is a e-healthcare business’s website which deals with private and sensitive information such as: personally, identifiable information, health information, health records, credit card information and so on. Detailed below is the methodology, findings and recommendations.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong><u>Section 1 - Methodology
</u><br><br></strong></div><div>A combination of GDPR and ISO was used for vulnerability identification.  ISO methodology involves implementing a risk assessment that can be frequently reviewed and enhanced to assess and correct, identifying the activities for which standards are used. ISO 27,001 is a standard outlining how any business should handle risk at every level (ISO.org, 2013).</div><br><div>
</div><div>GDPR is a mandatory requirement for organizations that collect, store and process data that belong to EU Citizens regardless of where the organisation is based.  It is important to be aware of the key GDPR principles as it will identify vulnerabilities that could threaten the organisations data, it will enable the organization to adhere to GDPR requirements, avoiding future penalties and as an overall, the findings help the management to recognize and value data protection.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Below are the basic principles of the GDPR which are known as the legal framework of GDPR:</div><br><div> 
</div><div>1. Data minimization: Store or process the minimum amount of personal data to what is only necessary.
</div><div>2. Limitation of purpose: Store or process the data type as minimum as possible to serve the purpose only.
</div><div>3. Accuracy: Keep personal information up to date and accurate.
</div><div>4. Confidentiality and Integrity: Security in storing personal data and in processing the data should be guaranteed. Systems, processes and personnel should be in place to guarantee avoidance of unlawful access, loss or breach of data.
</div><div>5. Transparency: Transparency in processing personal data.
</div><div>6. Accountability: Organizations storing personal data, should always be accountable to security breaches and must always keep compliant with the GDPR.
</div><div>7. Storage limitation: Limit the storage timeline of the data to what is only required, do not store personal data for longer than needed.</div><br><div>

Globally there are many security standards that apply to websites, specific to the US for example is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which focuses on personal health information. However the summary will focus on UK regulations. Two security Standards that can be considered here are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). GDPR encompasses; data capture, tracking, permissions, privacy policies and website security (Taylor, 2018).<br><br><div>A survey completed by McAfee Security, Beyond the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), mcafee.com/beyondGDPR asked businesses what  changes they were most concerned about impacting their businesses and reported (as seen below) that GDPR was indeed a top concern.</div><div><br><div><br></div><div>

</div><div>In evaluating the website aforementioned, numerous tools including (but not limited to) ImmuniWeb and 2GDPR were used to scan for GDPR compliance.<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;The results indicate that this website meets a majority of the requirements, there has for example, been put in place a sufficient level of cyber security using HTTPS encryption. There was no third-party tracking found and no third-party cookies were detected. However, the website lacks any cookie disclaimer, it is also missing a privacy policy and a listing for consent on the contact form. All three issues fall under the same Article – number 13; “GDPR requires a data controller to provide conspicuously visible notice to data subjects when collecting their personal data, including but not limited to data collected by web applications” (GDPR-info.eu, 2018).<br><br>To meet GDPR compliance it is important to implement mitigations pertaining to the issues mentioned above. This can be done by ensuring the below after which it is important to rerun compliance tests and verify compliance;<br><br></span></div><div>● Develop a privacy policy that is clearly written, concise and easily accessible on the website (HostPapa, 2021).
</div><div>● Add a cookie disclaimer banner to the website which visitors would need to agree to, thus granting consent before using any cookies, except strictly necessary ones (Koch, 2021).
</div><div>● Add a tick-box to the contact form, which requires visitors to confirm they have read and agree to your terms and privacy policy (Koch, 2021).
<br><br></div><div>The second standard considered is the (OWASP) Top 10. It’s notoriously important to ensure mitigation coverage of common Web Based Vulnerabilities using the OWASP Top 10. This is a standard which represents the most critical security risks related to web applications and focuses on Application Security Verification Standards (ASVS). An OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) scan was performed on the website as part of the evaluation’s penetration testing. As a result no critical alerts were generated, however there were some amber security exploits detected. One of the main exposures was the X-frame options header having not been configured, which laid bare a vulnerability to ClickJacking. The timestamp disclosure was also visible and should not have been. A site leaving such an exposure could remain vulnerable to exploitable design access&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">patterns. The last main vulnerability exposed here was the Cache-Control Header Set not having been configured, this allows cache content to be displayed which is not secure practice.</span></div><div><br>The above exposures need to be secured to ensure that OWASP standards are effectively incorporated. Mitigating measure can be put in place by;</div><br><div>
</div><div>● Ensuring the X-frame options HTTP header is set on all web pages, alternatively if the webpage will not be framed consider denying this function (Mozilla, 2021).</div><div>● Have management confirm the timestamp disclosure data is not sensitive (Auger, 2010).
</div><div>● Ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set to ‘no-cache’, ‘no-store’, and ‘must-revalidate’ (Mozilla, 2021).
</div><div><br></div><div>In summary the evaluation shows that this website is not currently GDPR compliant and is potentially exploitable. However, by establishing some select mitigations the goal of compliance is achievable in a relatively short time frame. Ensuring one’s website remains compliant is vital to the cyber security function of any corporation.
<br><br></div><div><strong>Section 5 – Final Conclusions
</strong></div><div><br>The EU has enforced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since May 2018. This means all those collecting, storing, using or dealing with personal data of E. U. citizens in any means should be taking all of the GDPR standards into consideration.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>Mandating compliance requirements could be troublesome but in the long term, there is always recognition. Client’s and customer’s data privacy and safety always brings happy customers back to the business.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Successfully completing a GDPR audit is the final step toward a GDPR compliance which every company that processes, stores or deals with European citizen’s data should be compliant with. For such organizations, it is also recommended to complete internal audits every 3 to 6 months to ensure continuity with the GDPR compliance.</div><br><div>
