(2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth).<div><br></div><div>Answer the following discussion questions:</div><div><br></div><div>- What are the major threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the paper?</div><div>- How would you mitigate against these?<br><br><strong><u>INITIAL POST</u></strong><br><br>Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems and Technology (Sighealth) discusses play by play details of a real time hack of a medical device and considers cyber vulnerabilities of the type perhaps not previously considered by the health sector. Below will discuss the major threats and vulnerabilities as well as mitigation strategies that could be enacted as a result.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;As referenced by Tamari (2021) healthcare has been the most targeted industry for cyber criminals. A report issued by the National Vulnerably database show that the number of reported vulnerabilities has tripled in the last five years. According to CISA in 2020 there were only 11 vulnerabilities reported by medical device manufacturers in the United States however there are thousands of device manufacturers (Tamari, 2021).</div><div><br></div><div>Two attack methods were used to gain access and disrupt the medical mannequin, a brute force attack which targeted the wifi and a denial-of-service attack which in turn rendered the unit unresponsive.  A Brute force attack tries every single passcode combination according to a rainbow table or dictionary provided to the software. This method of attack is very effective as you can set it and leave it to run until you have gained entry (Varonis, 2021). A Denial of service (DOS) attack is designed to shutdown or make the target unusable. This is accomplished by flooding the target with a large amount of data which the device cannot handle causing it to become unresponsive.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Brute force attacks have proven to be very effective, according to Verisons 2020 data breach report 80% of breaches in the USA occurred by gaining credentials. There are several ways to mitigate this type of attack such as changing passwords frequently, increasing the length passwords, limiting login attempts and implementing multifactor authentication. As Brute force attacks take a long time to deploy, one proactive approach would be to monitor and set alerts for this type of attack and then stop it before the full breach occurs (Varonis, 2021).</div><div><br></div><div>Mitigating DOS attacks can be achieved by proactively monitoring a system for any unusual activity by creating a base line. In addition to this monitoring an effective method could also be to implement a VPN with MFA required to gain access to the medical device (Phoenixnapp, 2018).</div><div><br></div><div>Medical devices have changed from being fully non-connected to now being both wirelessly and software controlled. It’s worth bearing in mind that there is an international standard to which medical devices must certify, this is the IEC 62304 Medical device software and was put in place to prevent cyber-criminal events on medical devices. However, the standard has not been updated to consider and include either network connectivity or cybersecurity(Williams, Woolward, 2015). When medical device manufactures are required by law to implement strict security measures into the lifecycle of their products we will likely see the aforementioned threats and vulnerabilities decrease.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>References:</div><div><br></div><div>Nastassia Tamari, Director of Information Security Operations for BD (2021) Talking about cybersecurity vulnerabilities in medical devices shouldn’t be taboo, Hitconsultant.net.
