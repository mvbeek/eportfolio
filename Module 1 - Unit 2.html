For instance, it is possible to find out how much money is stolen from banks each year, but it is impossible to specify how much money is withdrawn electronically in a cybersecurity attack.<div><br></div><div>One of the major attacks took place a few years ago, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company also known as Aramco, is a public company which operates in the petroleum and natural gas sector, it is one of the biggest companies in the world by revenue. In 2013, a virus generated from an external source attacked the company and approximately 30,000 of its workstations were infected, the company supposes that the virus-infected only the workstations with no harm being done on the main part of the network (Van. B, Pretorius, B, 2015).</div><div><br></div><div>Such attacks would drive Aramco and other companies to invest in cybersecurity, as well as protecting the sensitive data, intellectual property, financial information, and trade secrets, as these are solid reasons for companies to consider cybersecurity issues.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, the increased number of breaches and cybersecurity attacks helped companies to be aware of the importance of cybersecurity, mainly for those companies that are utilizing cloud computing services or IoT technology.</div><div><br></div><div>References</div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Cashell, B.

It would be good to establish if your comments, particularly in your opening statement reflect solely your own opinion or if these points are made with reference to an academic body of writing?<br><br>In my professional experience companies tend to avoid investment in cybersecurity until a breach is made and the requirement becomes obvious to them due to substantial losses made. This can either be cash losses, ransomware payment needs, or even simply the paid loss of labor force hours due to technical systems being down.<br><br>Corporations are constantly looking for ROI, however, it can be difficult to qualify the quantitative reasons for such a high level of investment when they have yet to experience the damage of a security breach (Gordon, Loeb, Lucyshyn 2014). Once they have experienced a rupture, however, it tends to be much easier to secure the project financing and sign off the labor hours and software required.<br><br>Whilst you refer to ‘companies’ in general, it could also be important to consider the size of the corporations that we are referring to. For each institution, it will likely be essential that the cost of the security implementation is not higher than the potential cost of a breach. We must remember that risk is relative. These costs are potentially much more easily absorbed by multinational corporations than small ltd businesses.<br><br>Reference:<br><br>Lawrence A. Gordon, Martin P.

I would certainly agree that breaches of a corporation’s cyber vulnerabilities can have devastating legal effects. Considering to what degree legal complications could arise would certainly be an interesting further discussion.<br><br>You mention how being attacked in the weakness of one’s cyber susceptibilities could affect a company’s image. A good example of this would be when BA’s “380 000 payment cards were compromised” (Gulf News, P1, 2018) it would have caused a huge amount of disruption to their operations but more importantly was a public relations disaster.<br><br>I agree that cybersecurity is very much a matter of national security. China is a global leader in this respect, highlighted by their cybersecurity law passed in 2016.

It’s interesting to read your background on Colonial but it would be good to have some more detail.  In your opening, you state that small and large industries still use older systems due to cost constraints. As your discussion is about the Colonial Pipeline specifically one would assume you’re suggesting that the Colonial pipeline has outdated systems? This statement is not supported by facts or any reference which could provide more weight to your viewpoint.<br><br>You mention that the Russian hacker’s group DarkSide is famous, it might be a good idea to reference other high-profile and successful hacks that DarkSide has spearheaded. DarkSide is a relatively new hacking group having only been established in August 2020. The company offers their services injecting ransomware into companies, they work cross continentally focusing on both Europe and the USA (Palmer, 2021). After the Colonial attack, President Biden stated that the US government would go after those responsible (Sharma, 2021). Interestingly a few hours after the attack DarkSide released a statement saying they had lost control of their webservers as well as funds made from some ransom payments (TRTWorld, 2021).<br><br>References:<br><br>Ewan Palmer 2021, What is DarkSide?

Whatsapp is a text and voice messaging service which uses networks such cellular networks or wifi. With its broad userbase it is especially important that the user feel secure and confident that their messages cannot be intercepted or altered.<div><br></div><div>I will now examine the messaging service in the context of data confidentially, in particular while sending messages (data in transit)</div><div><br></div><div>In the introduction into cyber security lecture the ethical responsibility of cyber security, namely data protection, data confidentiality and privacy were mentioned. Data confidentially is described as minimising the amount of exposed data (Troncoso, 2019). Especially data in transit from one endpoint to another via a network like the internet is at risk of being exposed and having its confidentially compromised. To send data via networks is the core service of WhatsApp. Interception of the data, often called man-in-the-middle attack, can change the content of the data package before it reaches its destination (Albugmi et al., 2016) . Hence, it is especially important to protect data in transit with the help of encryption technologies. End-to-end encryption (E2EE) can help to mitigate the risk of data interception by encrypting the data at the point of origin and decrypting it at its destination (Troncoso, 2019). WhatsApp is currently using a comprehensive E2EE provided by the acquired company Whisper (Jon, 2014).</div><div><br></div><div>This shows that WhatsApp has invested heavily in the data confidentiality of their data in transit (messages) and “brought encryption to the masses” (Dwoskin, 2014).</div><div><br></div><div>However, WhatsApp still faces criticism for failing to deal with malware and viruses as well as privacy issues (Black, 2020). In conclusion, WhatsApp is taking steps and has invested towards ethical responsibility in terms of cyber security, but still has a long way to go.</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">&nbsp;</span><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">References:</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Albugmi, A. et al.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I found your discussion interesting because WhatsApp is such a widely used service globally. Your data stems from 2017 which is a little dated; looking at their most recent statistics, with two billion users they are currently the most widely used messenger app in the world and have over 100 billion messages sent daily. It’s impressive to see that India has the most monthly operating users numbered 390 million (Dean, 2021). To your point, one can imagine that confidentiality is not only a hugely challenging issue for them but also a vitally important one.<br><br>When contemplating the confidentiality WhatsApp offers, it’s perhaps interesting to consider cases in the USA where messages have been attempted to be used by prosecutions as evidence in court. WhatsApp has notoriously denied this access to their database as evidence and is a huge minefield for them to navigate. If this messenger service were permitted to be used in court (as proof of or in defense of a crime) WhatsApp could be a party to breaching various privacy laws which would create both a political and logistical nightmare for them (The Hindu, 2021).<br><br>As pertains to our recent seminar regarding global company’s dealing with the ongoing struggles associated with cybersecurity, it would be interesting to learn more about the company Whisper. What exactly do they offer WhatsApp, how do they mitigate risk, what surety’s they offer, and for how much they are willing to be accountable? It would seem that WhatsApp users fall victim to phishing attacks although in March 2020 a mystery database was exposed supposedly been linked to WhatsApp (GearBrain, 2021).<br><br>References:<br><br>Brain Dean 2021, Backlinko, WhatsApp 2021 User Statistics: How Many People Use WhatsApp?, https://backlinko.com/whatsapp-users, PTI 2021<br><br>The Hindu, Supreme Court seeks WhatsApp reply on plea for non-sharing of UPI data with any third party,<br>GearBrain Editorial Team 2021, Data Breach Security Report for 2020,</p></blockquote>
