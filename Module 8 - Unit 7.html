This is something that is considered particularly in research studies involving a relatively wide sample (e.g., questionnaire).<br><br><strong>Unbiasedness and Precision</strong><br>Ideally, we want any measurement taken from our sample to be unbiased. In other words, to be representative of the true population value.<br><br>Bias can come into measurements in many ways, but choosing a random sample is one way to avoid this.<br>If our measurements are precise, then we mean they are repeatable. So, if another investigation is undertaken using the same methods, they should obtain similar results.<br><br>Ideally, our sample values are both unbiased and precise.<br>An estimate of a parameter taken from a random sample is known to be unbiased.<br>As the sample size increases, it becomes more precise.<br><br><strong>Random Samples<br></strong><br>Often a population will contain too many individuals to study easily so we tend to use a sample. A well-chosen sample will contain most of the information about a particular population characteristic. The sample should be representative of the population, that is, the members of the sample should have similar characteristics to the population.<br><br>To avoid bias in the selection of the sample a random sample is chosen. This ensures that everyone in the population has an equal chance of being chosen. The word "random" describes the way in which it is selected. Approaching people in the street, or in a supermarket, to answer your questionnaire is not a random sample as not everyone in your population of interest has an equal chance of being selected. Also, self-selecting samples, mainly from online surveys, is not a random sample and is more likely to be biased than any sample.

                <h5 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mb-2 display-7"><strong><u>INITIAL POST</u><br><br></strong></h5>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">In the research and design context, ethics is concerned with the moral issues arising from the research activities, outcomes, and conduct of the researcher. The scaffolding of ethical research discussions results from notorious unethical research practices traced to the 16th century. The disclosures of bioethical scandals like the Guatemala STD studies and the cultivation of the HeLa cell in the US escalated the need to develop measures to enhance ethical governance in research (Knijnenburg et al., 2022). Stringent measures were required to guarantee that research does not unduly harm humans, animals, and the environment. Recent scandals like Cambridge Analytica have raised considerable ethical concerns about data privacy, especially in computing.<br><br>Weinbaum et al. (2019) critically analysed two hundred popular peer-reviewed articles on scientific research ethics. The comprehensive analysis reveals the commonalities and differences in ethical considerations across diverse scientific disciplines. Ethical principles primarily apply to ethical scientific inquiry, researchers' ethical conduct, and participants' treatment. The researchers identified ten ethical principles cutting across scientific and technical disciplines.<br><br>Figure 1 (Below) shows the categories of the ethical principles of scientific research. Various principles of ethical scientific research apply to the case study on the accuracy of information. Abi is a researcher, and statistical programmer tasked with a noble scientific inquiry to review the nutritional value of Whizz, a new cereal.<br><br>The first ethical concern is the ethicality of Abi's action to analyse correct data to support different conclusions. According to the principle of integrity, researchers must demonstrate honesty and truthfulness when executing scientific inquiries (Weinbaum et al., 2019). Scientific researchers must not fabricate data, omit relevant data, or falsify results. Therefore, Abi will be deemed unethical if the differing conclusions do not benefit society.<br><br>The second ethical concern regards whether Abi is obligated to present both positive and negative analyses. The principle of non-discrimination states that research should minimise attempts to narrow research benefits to specific groups (Weinbaum et al., 2019). Abi is not obligated to provide both analyses, but the duty to society demands that scientific research should contribute to the well-being of society. Therefore, if providing both positive and negative analyses will be beneficial, Abi should proceed.<br><br>Moreover, the issue of whether Abi is responsible for the use of the results is a complex ethical concern. The principle of professional competence demands scientific researchers to engage in work they are qualified to perform. Professional discipline and integrity principles also highlight the need for researchers to be truthful and honest (Weinbaum et al., 2019). Though Abi may not be held responsible for the results, the results should benefit society. According to the principle of beneficence, research must strive for benefits to outweigh the risks.<br><br>The final ethical concern is the recommended course of action if the manufacturer only publishes positive results. The principle of conflict of interest applies to this issue. Scientific research should minimise issues that could lead to biased results (Knijnenburg et al., 2022). As an ethical researcher and professional, Abi can take appropriate legal action to ensure that the manufacturer does use the results discriminatively. The manufacturer is liable for the legal, social, and professional implications of using the results. De Boer (2021) asserts that omitting some nutritional information violates the European Regulation on food information to consumers (FIC) and relevant agencies in the UK. Consequently, the results of scientific research must be used correctly and ethically.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br><br>De Boer, A. (2021).
