                    <strong><br></strong><br><strong>Module 8 - Unit 1</strong><br><br><strong>Scientific Investigation and Ethics</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><strong><br></strong><br><div>Week 1, you will be introduced to the Ethics of Research and the Scientific Method.</div><div><br></div><div>The first question to answer in this module would be “What is the Purpose of Research?”. Whether you continue in Higher Education or move into industry, it is essential to understand why you carry out research. The 3 main reasons/purposes of research are: to explore (familiarise yourself with a topic/situation), to describe (describe your findings), to explain (answer the question “why?”) (QuestionPro, 2021).<br><br>One of the most important approaches in research is the scientific method. See Andersen &amp; Hepburn (2020) for details on the history of this method which involves observation, hypothesis, reasoning and testing. The combination of these elements can vary significantly depending on the discipline of a researcher.</div><div><br></div><div>Our focus in this unit is on the types of reasoning used in the scientific method as these are the key approaches for problem-solving. The 2 core types of reasoning are Deductive and Inductive reasoning.</div><div><br></div><div>Both deduction and induction are forms of inference, which means reaching a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning. However, as the diagram shows (Miessler, 2020), deduction moves you (the researcher) from an idea to an observation, while induction takes you from an observation to an idea.</div><div><br></div><div>Deduction can get you to a perfect conclusion, but only if all your assumptions are 100% correct. Therefore, researchers in a non-lab/scientific setting would find deduction more difficult to use because it is often difficult to find a set of fully agreed-upon facts on which to structure their arguments.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, induction is used more frequently to solve everyday problems. It is particularly useful for problems that involve partial information about a situation or activity and the conclusions may not always be right, but they are more practical.</div><div><br></div><div>Before delving further into the research process. It is essential to develop an understanding of research ethics. Ethics is an area is of importance when conducting any piece of research, particularly where people may be involved.<br><br>So, what are Research Ethics? This can be reviewed by focusing on the key principles that need to be applied when preparing and carrying out your research project, as described by the Menlo Report (Bailey, 2013):</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Respect:</strong> If you are using individuals, they must take part voluntarily. You must respect their decision to participate or not (gaining their consent). Your participants should also have the right to anonymity.</div><div><strong>Beneficence:</strong> The balance here is between maximising the benefit you gain from your research and the risk it may pose for the participants.</div><div><strong>Justice:</strong> This relates to the equal treatment of your participants, as well as the fair distribution of the benefits of the research.</div><div>Respect for Law and Public Interest: A researcher should always engage in legal due diligence and be accountable for their actions. Research should be designed, reviewed and undertaken to ensure recognised standards of integrity are met, and quality and transparency are assured.<br><br></div><div>It is imperative to point out at this point that though both ethics and morals are concerned with ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, they are also quite different. Mitchell (2018) discusses several scenarios in white hat/ethical hacking where they may be in conflict.</div><div><br></div><div>Alongside ethics, a researcher must be professional in all areas of their research and practice. A good explanation of what professionalism should mean to you in the various fields of Computer Science is given in the BCS Code of Conduct. This is provided in your reading for this week, as well as information on data protection and intellectual property.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>In this unit we shall:</strong></div><div>- Introduce the elements within the scientific method.</div><div>- Introduce the various aspects of ethical issues in research, and by extension, in professional practice.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</strong></div><div>- Differentiate between inductive and deductive reasoning.</div><div>- Understand why ethics are important and how they may relate to your area of research and your professional&nbsp; &nbsp;practice.<br><br><strong><u>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</u></strong></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Discussion Topic: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</strong></div><div>Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).<br><br><strong>Topic Chosen: Case Study: Medical Implants</strong><br><br></div><div>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved.

This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.</div><div><br></div><div>Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Corazón created an implanted heart health monitoring device. As a fundamental security precaution, it could be accessed only via short-range connections, necessitating the smartphone and implants to be at close range and data transmitted adhered to standard encryption7 (ACM, 2018, n.p.).<br><br>Corazón's practices reflect the ideals of numerous Code tenets. In line with the objectives of Principle 1.1 of ACM ethics (2018) and 1 a (BCS, 2022, 2), Corazon's goods and charitable endeavours of Corazon benefit society as well as the welfare of people. Corazón showed that they were committed to Guideline 2.3 by operating within the confines of governmental organizations. This is similar to principle 2d (BCS, 2022, 2). Principle 2.9 OF ACM's aspirations for strong security are upheld through Corazón's encryption and risk disclosure usage.<br><br>Moreover, Corazón demonstrates adherence to Principle 2.6 of ACM (2018) and 2a (BCS, 2022, 2) by limiting their engineers' activities to areas of specialization and relying on accepted cryptographic methods instead of trying to invent an untested proprietary solution. The researcher and Corazón's discussion also emphasize a crucial element of Guideline 2.5. Corazón's solutions are committed to extensive and in-depth risk analysis, which is evident in their design and execution. Corazón also encouraged unbiased security assessments to find any further problems its designers may have missed.<br><br>Corazón responded properly and promptly to assess the severity of the vulnerability when it was identified to minimize the damage. Indeed, research shows that risk assessment eliminates financial loss (Lee, 2021, 659). Using a hard-coded parameter in the implants is one issue with Corazón's design. Due to the characteristics of the gadget, it might be challenging to change this design decision if it turns out to be essential. Corazon cannot yet determine the extent of the danger introduced by design due to a lack of evidence. The ongoing dedication of Corazón to safety and advancement also serves as an excellent example of Guideline 3.7 (ACM, 2018, n.p.), which is similar to standard 2f (BCS, 2022, 2). The quick rise of Corazón in this highly specialized area of health care illustrates how technology is being incorporated into general societal infrastructure.<br><br><strong> References</strong><br><br>ACM Ethics.
