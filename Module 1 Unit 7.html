                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Haroun, great post regarding WPA2 as well as multifactor authentication. Of particular interest is the section where you mention the encryption used in WPA2 and how it safeguards against a cyber-attack. While WPA2 is certainly a vast improvement on its predecessors WEP and WPA. Interestingly WPA2 is vulnerable to a Pixie Dust attack utilising Airgeddon which can crack networks in seconds (Kody, 2018).<br><br> As you know WPA2 has different versions such as WPA2-PSK, which is less secure than AES, this protocol is mainly used in small offices, airports and home networks. This wireless standard is widely utilised as it has compatibility with a wide range of devices. However, a brute-force dictionary attack could be performed on this type of wireless network which would allow an attacker to be able to decrypt the traffic, obtain the pre-shared key then capture the handshake when a user joins the network (Goel, 2021).<br><br>In today’s wireless filled world it is imperative to safeguard networks in order for the right person to gain access to the right information. To gain an advantage and to keep up with the latest security technologies one should look into new advancements, would you consider WPA3? WPA3-SAE (simultaneous authentication of equals) to replace WPA2-PSK, WPA3-SAE utilises 128-bit encryption key and forward secrecy protocol to protect against dictionary attacks. WPA3-Enterprise to replace WPA2-Enterprise, “which uses a 192-bit encryption key and a 48-bit initialization vector as requested by sensitive organizations” (Goel, 2021).<br><br>References:<br><br>Goel, Shorya (2021), DATA SECURITY – WPA-2 PSK VULNERABILITIES, Encryption Consulting, Available from: https://www.encryptionconsulting.com/is-wpa2-psk-vulnerable.html [Accessed on 20 June 2021]<br><br>Kody (2018), Hack WPA &amp; WPA2 Wi-Fi Passwords with a Pixie-Dust Attack Using Airgeddon,<br><br>Null-Byte,  Available from: https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-wpa-wpa2-wi-fi-passwords-with-pixie-dust-attack-using-airgeddon-0183556.html [Accessed 20 June 201]</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Mohamad, great post about utilizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). Of particular interest is the way you described the role IDS and IPS play in an organization, how they monitor the network as well as detect and block anomalies. Perhaps, what may be useful is to describe the challenges that IDS and IPS cause and how these affect the environment in which they are used.<br><br>One of the most frequent problems with IPS is “the detection of false positives or false negatives” (Urrutai, Ierace, Bassett, 2005). When a false positive occurs, the system blocks the activity on the network, assumes the activity is malevolent and causes denial of service to a valid user. Alternately a false negative on the system allows the malicious event to pass by unnoticed. IDS also have their share of problems, mainly caused by the systems producing an abundant number of alerts. One IDS user for example disclosed that he had over 1.8m million alerts monthly (Urrutai, Ierace, Bassett, 2005). As one can imagine this would be an almost impossible amount of work to sift through. Figure 1 (Aljanabi, Ismail, Ali, 2021) shows an interesting diagram highlighting the challenges of an IDS. These systems are also vulnerable; attackers can fool an IDS into thinking an attack is genuine traffic and pass by unnoticed. The techniques used for this type of attack are application hijacking, fragmentation, denial of service and obfuscation (Carlo, 2021).<br><br>It would seem both systems require a good amount of finetuning to acquire the desired results. However, considering both systems and even taking into consideration their weaknesses, the consensus seems to be that the benefits out way the long-term advantages as well as the overall performance (Urrutai, Ierace, Bassett, 2005).<br><br>References:<br><br>Nick Ierace, Cesar Urrutia, Richard Bassett (2005), INTRUSION PREVENTION SYSTEMS, Ubiquity, Volume 2005, Issue July 2005, pp 2, https://doi.org/10.1145/1071916.1071927<br><br>Carlo, Corbin (2021),  Intrusion detection evasion: How Attackers get past the burglar alarm, SANS Institute Information Security Reading room, pp3, Available from:  https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/intrusion-detection-evasion-attackers-burglar-alarm-1284<br><br>Mohammad Aljanabi, Mohd Arfian Ismail, Ahmed Hussein Ali (2021), International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems, Volume 14, Issue 1, 2021, Pages 560 – 571, Figure 1: Intrusion detection system (IDS) overview.

The next-generation firewall allows you to identify applications regardless of the ports used and decide on the security policy based on that (Media.paloaltonetworks.com. 2021). It also facilitates the way users are being allowed or denied access to particular resources when those users are mobile (or connect to different parts of the network that have different subnets).

Do you know if next-generation firewalls also protect web applications? According to Verizon, 43% of cybersecurity breaches in 2020 targeted web applications. Additionally, a study on applications by Okta found that on “average business uses 88 applications” this is an increase by 21% on the past three years (Spencer, 2020).<br><br>One critique would be that the discussion topic requests identification and discussion of two security technologies, in your discussion you mention just one. However, you do also mention that next-generation firewalls use additional security features like IPS, application control and deep packet inspections. Perhaps one of the above-mentioned features could be the additional security technology required for this discussion. Additionally, a next-generation firewall can block malware from infiltrating a network, this a something a traditional firewall could not accomplish (Brook, 2020). Next-generation firewalls are enterprise-level and scale-out very well (Paloalto, 2021).

Most home computers do not have proper security patches applied to vulnerable applications, Web Browsers and plugins on time.</div><div><br></div><div>·       A smart device such as a Mobile Phone, a Tablet specially if used by younger children who would keep tapping on advertisements and possible adware, malware links.</div><div><br></div><div>·       A home’s Internet Modem or managed/unmanaged Network Switches, the firmware could be easily manipulated or bugged as could be used to sniff all incoming and outgoing network traffic.</div><div><br></div><div>·       Home’s Wireless device or overall Wireless network security, a weaker Wireless network key and/or out of date security protocols such as Wired Equivalent Privacy.</div><div><br></div><div>·       Unauthorized physical access of your work computer.</div><div><br></div><div>All above examples could be threats to your work device and could result in a massive Cyber Security issue for your organization’s Intellectual Property, and sensitive data such as Personally Identifiable Information (Nikolay Pankov, 2021).</div><div><br></div><div>To mitigate the issues, let’s evaluate some Microsoft Security products in this discussion.</div><div><br></div><div>1.   Antivirus and Antispyware, or more?</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">A well tested antivirus and an antispyware solution at the very basic level is a must to provide basic end device Security protection. Microsoft Windows Defender can be a very good candidate solution. Windows Defender has evolved so much since its introduction. Microsoft Windows Defender was developed around the core of an older product called GIANT Antispyware. Microsoft acquired GIANT on December 2004 (Jonathan Hassell, Tony Campbell, 2007). The free version of Windows Defender provides Antivirus and Antispyware protection while the Enterprise version provides additional protections. Firewall, Email protection, Web and URL filtering, Application scan and advanced Data Telemetry and User Behavior Analytics are the examples. With all these capabilities, Windows Defender can equip a work computer with defense against network threats at the device level.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>2.     VPN</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">A Point to Site VPN connecting the work PC directly through a secure and encrypted tunnel to the company’s network can add more security to the data travelling in and out of a work computer. Microsoft Azure VPN can be an ultimate solution in this case. Microsoft Azure VPN can be configured to connect the end device to the company network as a Point to Site connection securing the data in transit through a secure and encrypted private tunnel.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>3.     User Behavior Analytics</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">User Behavior Analytics enables IT and Security teams to get alerted if a suspicious behavior is detected such as massive uploads or downloads of data, a sudden change in user’s public IP address location or impossible travel distance, and risky sign-ins using at risk devices or application could be the examples. Microsoft Defender is capable of providing the telemetry using its sensors at the end device level to a very robust service called Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) service.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>4.     Device Compliance Policy</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Security policies such as a signed-in session lock, data encryption, antivirus protection, and data travel through secure and encrypted network and such are all useless if there is not a compliance policy enforcement in place.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>The Device Compliance Policy should clearly enforce all security configurations and clearly mention that any device should fail any security requirement marked as noncompliant immediately. A noncompliant device should be treated completely differently with very limited or no access to company’s IP.</div><div><br></div><div>Let’s now discuss some of the challenges we could encounter along the way:</div><div><br></div><div>1.     Cost</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">While a simple end device protection which provides Antivirus and Antispyware protection is free but adding additional features can cost from USD $5.5 per user per month with minimum 50 license purchase to almost USD $50 per user per month including the VPN security, data telemetry and all. This could be an enormous additional cost to businesses which could potentially back them up from utilizing the product (MJ Caparas, 2021).</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>2.     Complexity and understanding the science</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Every solution comes with its pre-requisites and configuration complexities. Microsoft Security products has its own science, terms and phrases to understand.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Any incorrect and misconfiguration could result in either completely locking the company network for everyone or fully opening the network to all Cyber Threats. So proper understanding or knowing the science behind the terms and having a clear picture of the threats such as a Threat Model would help in proper configuration (Computer and Security, 2012).</div><div><br></div><div>3.     Automation vs Human eyes</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.1rem;">With today’s technological advances, there are capabilities to automate tasks and remedies for issues but human resource is almost equally important. A knowledgeable Cyber Security team is as important as Cyber Security tools.</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>References:</div><div><br></div><div>Bajarin, T.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">An interesting post about working from home and the challenges associated thereof. Of particular interest, the technology software’s mentioned, notably Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Pre Covid19 Microsoft Teams had 32 million daily active users. Within a matter of weeks, post the pandemic announcement, Microsoft Teams daily active user count jumped to 75 million and as of April 2021, the count has increased to 145 million (Warren, 2021). Zoom boasted an impressive 300 million daily active users, up 500% on pre Covid19 numbers. When interviewed about why users preferred Zoom over the Tech giants’ offerings the consensus was “It was just simply way easier” (Bond, 2021).<br><br>As Zoom’s popularity increased so did hackers’ interest. Zoom’s security was extremely lax at that point which meant intruders could crash Zoom meetings, these attacks were aptly named Zoombombing. Zoom had told users that meetings were fully encrypted when they weren’t, this flaw meant hackers could spy through webcams and tap into microphones (Bond, 2021). While comparing both sites, Qureshi highlights how Zoom meetings were breeched however Teams meetings were not (2021).<br><br>One critique of your post pertains to the discussion topic assigned; although VPN’s and Antivirus could be considered basic forms of security technology, the other software’s wouldn’t. There’s no clear distinction concerning any advanced security technologies to which you may be referring. Considering the aforementioned vulnerabilities and flaws in video conferencing would the security measures you alluded to prevent attacks?<br><br>After a rapid, unprecedented move to working from home, globally workforces had to communicate in alternative ways. As such, many turned to video conferencing, Zoom was a more user-friendly platform than others but also easier to breach. If Zoom had established cybersecurity measures initially, would they have avoided such issues and been able to create an authentic level of integrity giving users more confidence in the platform’s offerings? If so, it might be interesting to analyse which two security technologies could have acted as the most appropriate preventative measures.<br><br>References:<br><br>Warren, Tom (2021), Microsoft Teams usage jumps to 145 million daily active users, The Verge, Available from: https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats.html [Accessed on June 19 2021]<br><br>Bond, Shannon (2021), A Pandemic Winner: How Zoom Beat Tech Giants To Dominate Video Chat, NPR, Available from: https://www.npr.org/2021/03/19/978393310/a-pandemic-winner-how-zoom-beat-tech-giants-to-dominate-video-chat?t=1624130805238.html [Accessed on June 19 2021]<br><br>Qurashi, Azam (2021), Microsoft Teams vs. Zoom: A Side-by-Side Comparison, Intradyn Email hiving &amp; eDiscovery, Available from: https://www.intradyn.com/microsoft-teams-vs-zoom/ [Accessed on June 19 2021]<br><br></p></blockquote>
