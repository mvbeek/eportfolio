You will start with an initial research idea and then ask pertinent questions that may need further revisions before you prepare your research proposal, which is the foundation to your research.</div><div><br></div><div>One element of the proposal is a literature review within your chosen area. A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic. It provides an overview of current knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods, and gaps in the existing research. In this unit, you will be introduced to the process of completing a literature review and how to present your review.

First, the issue of physical invasiveness, and then of data privacy.  The device is literally inside someone’s body, this is about as invasive as you can get.  Additionally, it must be able to protect the privacy of the patient data it gathers.  The Medical Implant Risk Analysis case study does mention it employs cryptographic algorithms to secure the data at rest, and also when transmitting.  Therefore, the business is clearly trying to adhere to ACM’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (the Code)’s principles of respecting privacy 1.6 and honouring confidentiality 1.7 (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018).</div><div><br></div><div>There is the possibility of human error in implementation, maintenance, and monitoring, and Corazón’s “vocal” commitment fosters ambiguity, thus leaving them at risk of violating principle 1.2, and also the Belmont Report’s Beneficence principle (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1979).</div><div><br></div><div>It also offers its services to those who would otherwise be unable to access it, using charities as a vehicle, thus considering BCS’s Code of Conduct, Public Interest principle 4 (British Computer Society, N.D.).</div><div><br></div><div>Running a bug bounty program is a very positive ethical step as it shows Corazón cares about patients enough to introduce such proactive security measures to protect their privacy.  Short range communication is also a good choice to protect this.  These actions adhere to ACM’s Code principle 2.5, and 2.6 is adhered to by default (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018).</div><div><br></div><div>Corazón additionally adheres to several other BCS Code of Ethics’ principles, including Professional Competence and Integrity, principles 1, 4, and 6 (British Computer Society, N.D.).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>References</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Association for Computing Machinery.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Thank you, Richard, for your fantastic post. It is evident that Corazón's heart implants have potential ethical conflicts, as you describe. The issue of data privacy and physical invasiveness is urgent that Corazón must investigate. The fact that the implant has a value that is hard coded into it is one of the characteristics of the design by Corazón that raises particular concerns. Because of the complexity of the gadget, modifying this design feature in the event that it was required to do so would be challenging. On the other hand, there is not enough evidence available to evaluate the magnitude of the danger posed by this design. I like that you have acknowledged the efforts Corazón is employing to protect its data privacy and adhere to ACM's guidelines that honour confidentiality and respect people's privacy. <br><br>One more example that stands out to me as exemplifying the importance of Principle 2.5 is Corazón's discussion with the researchers. Corazón's dedication to rigorous risk analysis is displayed in the care with which its products are developed and deployed. Even more so, the Corazón team encouraged third-party security testing to unearth any problems the team may have missed. Corazón took prompt and responsible action after discovering a possible security hole to assess the problem's severity and take precautions to limit the damage.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br><br>ACM Ethics 2017, Available from: https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-maliciousinputs-to-content-filters/, [Accessed 6 October 2022]<br><br>British Computer Society.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Thank you, Adrian, for your post. Indeed, Rogue Services violates several of the Code of Ethics Guidelines by allowing the hosting of malware and leaving their system vulnerable to cyber risks. Indeed, Rogue contradicts the specific principle 2.5 in the ACM (2017) Code which stipulates that proper care needs to be taken to recognize and alleviate potential vulnerabilities in computer and machine learning structures. In addition, multiple Code principles are being broken by Rogue. Rogue violated Principles 1.1 and 1.2 by enabling the hosting of malware attacks, which aided the harm committed by its clients. Since Rogue knew that their servers were hosting malware that was allowing unauthorized infections, they were also implicated in the violation of Principle 2.8. To cap it all off, Rogue disregarded Principle 3.1 and did not act in the public interest. Thus, had Rogue put in measures to protect its clients, it would have been shielded from such vulnerabilities. <br><br>On assessing the code of ethics according to BSC, you mentioned the code of conduct Rogue failed to follow. Which specific code was that? Perhaps you can explain how specifically Rogue's conduct led to breaking the code. <br><br>Overall, I could gather several violations from your post, which analyzed Rogues violations, particularly BCS Code 2f, which states that an entity should avoid harming other people, their possessions, repute, or occupation through use of malicious or negligent activities or inactions. Rogue violates this by exposing people to vulnerabilities.<br><br><strong>References:</strong><br><br>ACM Ethics 2017, Available from: https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/using-the-code/case-maliciousinputs-to-content-filters/, [Accessed 6 October 2022]<br><br>British Computer Society.
