                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">A great post Muhammad, of particular interest are the 6 six examples of processes for securing personally identifiable information (PII). It would also be a good idea worthwhile to mention highlight that An Garda Síochána (AGS) is the national police service of the Republic of Ireland. Given this, what was the repercussion for mishandling of the sensitive data, was it just discipline to the police officer or did the company itself face any fine or court case?<br><br>The criminal justice sector in the UK has holds a wide range of sensitive information about regarding its citizens. However, UK law enforcement is somewhat exempt from GDPR’s scope, in certain circumstances when investigating a crime (ICO.org 2021). Interestingly there have been several law enforcement cases investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Some examples of this are outlined by (Conner, 2020) below;<br><br>-         The Greater Manchester Police was being fined £150,000 after three DVDs containing footage of interviews with victims of violent or sexual crimes got lost in the post.<br><br>-         Scotland Yard breached breaching data protection laws to spy on one of its officers while she was on sick leave.<br><br>-         The Ministry of Justice was being fined £180,000 for “serious failings” in the handling of confidential data following the loss of a hard drive containing the details of almost 3,000 prisoners at Erlestoke prison in Wiltshire.<br><br>When considered further it is apparent that there is a vital requirement for all, including nations own law enforcement, to be compliant with an international set of standardised regulations?? governing the rights of conglomerates, smaller corporations, and individual civilians across the globe. Cyber security feeds into ethical governance both on a corporate and governmental level. It has never held a more vital role in society than it does in today’s fully digitalised world.<br><br>Resources:<br><br>Hayes Connor. (2020, July 19).

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Mahamad, an interesting post regarding Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage being leaked. Of particular interest is that video footage is considered as controller and therefor falls under GDPR.  Your first paragraph mentions Facebook, although it has not been made clear how this relates to CCTV footage? You also mention that there was no agreement between RIA and Aramark, what does that mean for the outcome of the case?<br><br>Interestingly, one of the first penalties issued regarding the use of CCTV under GDPR was against an Austrian retailer (Irwin, 2021). The Austrian Data Protection Authority  (DPA) fined a retail company 4,800 euros for monitoring a public space without proper transparency and notice. It was considered that this CCTV surveillance was capturing too much of the sidewalk (Fritz, 2018) despite this ruling the awarded fine was minuscule compared some other fines issued in the UK. By contrast, for example, The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has previously issued fines totaling £282 million against British Airways and Marriott International for GDPR violations (Irwin, 2021).<br><br>The above all goes to show the importance for all cyber security professionals, in maintaining an awareness of local laws and regulations that companies fall under, in which parts of the world they are enforced and in what ways. In my view one part of compliance is maintaining a basic level simple corporate social responsibility whilst another is covering your own job security by ensuring your clients personal and professional data is always safely secure.<br><br>References:<br><br>Fritz, Gernot.
