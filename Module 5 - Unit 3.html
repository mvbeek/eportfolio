The Unit further discusses how users’ and designers’ mental models can be combined to achieve optimal design solution. The accessibility issues and their implications within the context of usable security design are also discussed.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>In this unit we shall:</strong></div><div>- Explore the use of mental models in identifying user perceptions and security preferences.</div><div>- Cover the use of mental models as an approach to designing usable security.</div><div>- Review the contextual design process and how they are applied to usable security.</div><div>- Discuss the concept of accessibility and their implications.</div><div><br><strong>On completion of this unit you will be able to:</strong></div><div>- Understand the concept of mental models and their use.</div><div>- Develop the ability to apply mental models to usable security design.</div><div>- Develop the awareness and the legal basis for accessibility in the context of usable security.</div><div><br></div><br><strong><u>INDIVIDUAL ESSAY</u></strong><br><br><strong>Assignment Topic</strong><div>For this first assignment, you need to fully outline your viewpoint on the human factors and socio-technical problems in this scenario below.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Queens Medical Centre is a community clinic and serves as the first point of call for any resident within the catchment area who happens to be unwell. The clinic has specialists in various areas of medicine. However, an appointment is required to schedule a consultation meeting with a specialist, which is done through a telephone call to the receptionist. The clinic has been experiencing high volume of calls, causing a lot of problems for residents to get access to care on time. Also, the management of Queens Medical Centre needs to plan to be able to respond to the rate of growth of the community population.</div><div><br></div><div>To address this problem, the clinic management has decided to acquire a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS). This will allow appointments to be booked online by prospective patients. The system will collect vital information from the patient to be able to determine which specialist is best to attend to a given case, considering the availability and workload of the specialist doctor.</div><div><br></div><div>The Management of the clinic is concerned about the recent high rate of cybercrime and the government’s policy on patient data protection. The IT team at the clinic has installed an ASMIS which is considered to be secure.</div><div><br></div><div>However, Management is aware that investing in technological solutions is not enough and that human factors must be equally addressed to ensure optimal security. As the Cyber Security Officer on the team that manages the clinic’s IT systems, you are to advise the team on the human factors that need to be addressed for ASMIS to be usable and secure.</div><br><br><strong><u>Human factors of an Appointment Scheduling Management Information System (March 2022)</u></strong><br><br><div>This essay will evaluate the human factors affecting an appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS) and how these could be mitigated. The essay is broken down into two sections: firstly identifying three human factors, followed by a critical discussion of implications covering various actors in the ASMIS.<br><br></div><div>Queens Medical Centre appointments have traditionally been made in person or telephonically, then added manually to a scheduling system. A scheduling system could be managed in paper form or electronically as a software like Microsoft Excel on one’s computer system with a locally stored database. Both methods above require a bona fide person available to manually take appointments and answer the phone. Large number of calls combined with the human intervention required could result in decreased customer satisfaction and patients not being attended to in a timely manner (Zhao, et al. 2017).<br><br></div><div>The above forms the basis in reasoning for utilizing an automated ASMIS which is thought to increase the quality of service received by patients, efficiency and productivity. The below discussion will focus on a grouped theme of “human factor”, the role of human behaviour in coping with cyberattacks and strengthening cyber defences (Nifakos et al, 2021).<br><br></div><div>The management of Queens medical centre are (naturally) concerned with the current high rate of cybercrime. NIST (2017) reported that 35% of all data breaches are attributed to negligence or human error. Interestingly Kaspersky Lab and B2B International undertook a study on the role that employees play in the fight against cybercrime, which involved over 5,000 businesses globally. The result of the study revealed that 52% of all businesses believed that they are at risk from within (Kaspersky, 2017).<br><br></div><div>Healthcare professionals have at times experienced the greatest volume of cyberattacks with most significant impact relating to social engineering (Nifakos et al, 2021). These types of attacks frequently occur due to the lack of the following human factors.<br><br></div><div>Training and awareness; Employees can be the weakest link in cyber defence, however with the right training employees can be your biggest allay. Take a fresh look at information security and awareness training, provide immersive new, fun learning opportunities to reinforce behavior change (Pollini et al, 2021).<br><br></div><div>Cyber culture; Embedding security into the corporate culture means that staff will be less overwhelmed when security incidents occur, increasing the probability of being reported efficiently (Tourinsky, 2021). Kasperky (2017) reports that 40% employees of businesses globally hide an incident when it happens.<br><br></div><div>Stakeholder and leadership engagement; Stakeholders play a vital role in the implementation and continual improvement in the cyber security lifecycle. Employees notice and respect senior management when they fully take on the cyber security space (Tourinsky, 2021). One idea is to incorporate cybersecurity effectively is to add it into the company’s annual key performance indicators (KPI).<br><br></div><div>Also worth consideration is the Zero Trust model. This framework is the methodology only permitting access to what’s needed to do jobs efficiently, requiring employees to validate themselves continuously. If in the event of a breach the attacker could only go so far as the user whom they compromised, this minimises the ‘blast radius’. Essentially providing another defence layer behind the firewall (Microsoft, 2020).<br><br></div><div>With the implementation of ASMIS, Queens medical centre will store sensitive personal identifiable information, thus be obligated to follow the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With the growing number of cyber-attacks in the healthcare industry, the practice will be required to share how they will use data collected, in compliance with this new legislation. GDPR recommends following Article Six, a requirement for processing personal data in a lawful manner (GDPR, 2018).</div><div><br></div><div>As from 2010 data breaches in the healthcare sector have increased exponentially and it is now one of the most targeted industries by cyber criminals. The critical implication to be considered here is namely that incorporating technology into the health field is leading to a greater level of precision in medicine, however cybersecurity measures must still be improved. Due to the nature of the accumulation of private healthcare data one can imagine why this information is sought out by cyber criminals (Argaw, et al. 2020).</div><div><br></div><div>ASMIS has been proven to dramatically improve efficiency and quality of service within the healthcare sector. However, digital transformation and the COVID-19 global pandemic expedited the adoption rate of health information systems at the loss of the human factor (Nifakos et al, 2021). The Human factor is a scientific field that is underutilized and undervalued in information security and cybersecurity (NSTC, 2016). To quote the father of cybersecurity Auguste Kerckhoffs, “It must be easy to use and must neither require stress of mind, nor the knowledge of a long series of events”. With that in mind one could propose that understanding the human factor is the key to mitigating security risks associated with human characteristics (Kadena and Gupi, 2021).</div><div><br></div><div>798 words</div><div><br></div><div><strong>References:</strong><br></div><div>Zhao, P., Yoo, I., Lavoie, J., Lavoie, B.J. and Simoes, E.
